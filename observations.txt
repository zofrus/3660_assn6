Justification Paragraph:

From Jason Fuller in Regards to Jordan-
    Jordan was a key contributer and took care of his assigned features. 
    He did a great job at helping break down the algorithms into sudo code
    and was a wonderful team player. I would work with him in a professional 
    environment and really enjoy it.
