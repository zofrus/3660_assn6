Justification Paragraph:

From Jason Fuller in Regards to Jordan-
    Jordan was a key contributer and took care of his assigned features. 
    He did a great job at helping break down the algorithms into sudo code
    and was a wonderful team player. I would work with him in a professional 
    environment and really enjoy it.

	the implementatin of our project. He worked hard to ensure that the

	implemented all of the features that were assigned to him, and worked
	together with me to ensure that all of the necessary components of the
	project were completed. He is fantastic!
