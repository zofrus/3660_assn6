//elevator -- the look

// sort list copy but not original list

// scan starts at the top, goes down to the last block
// calculate the distance((abs(difference))) between
// that block and the next block above it,
// then just do that for the next blocks sequentially
// going back up.

// keep track of difference in another array. then sum
// them at the end.
