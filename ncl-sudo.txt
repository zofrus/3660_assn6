// Make a copy of the list
// Make note of the index 0 of the list (let's call this number "head")
// Sort the list
// then do the difference of head and the item right after head in the sorted list (let's call this "second")
// then the diff of second and the item after second etc
// when you hit the final item in the sorted list find the diff of the last item and the item right before head ("OneAbove")
// then the diff of "OneAbove" and the item right above "OneAbove"
// continue this until you hit the first item in the list
// add all of the diffs together or keep a running total as you go
// return the sum of all the diffs
