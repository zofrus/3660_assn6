// start at index 0 from the list
// do the difference between 0 and 1
// then diff between 1 and 2
// then diff between 2 and 3 etc
// after you have gone through the whole list
// and stored the positive abs(differences) in
// another array, sum the other array. 
// or even just keep a running total of the
// differences then you will have what you need at 
// the end i.e. var bleh. bleh += bleh. ( in the loop )
